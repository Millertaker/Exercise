# Huge Navigation Exercise

## Overview

This exercise will have the candidate build a responsive layout for a site navigation.

Here are the guidelines for this exercise, please follow closely:

* We'll be evaluating your markup and styling skills, however, you might use Javascript just for opening and closing menu.
* CSS Pre-Compilers are fine (LESS, SASS), but no mixin libraries (Compass, Bourbon, Neat, Foundation, etc.)
* Chrome compliance is all that's required, all functions and features available in Chrome are in play.
* Nav must be responsive.
* Code must run after the following command, please ensure your code runs as you expect it to from a fresh checkout with these commands before submission.
* Page should look good across all viewport sizes.
* ZIP file and contained folder must be YourName_HugeNavExercise.zip.
* Please do not include node_modules folder in the ZIP.
* Primary navigation items: Work, About, Careers, Ideas, News, Events, Contact
* Secondary navigation items under About: What we do, How we work, Leadership
* Secondary navigation items under Careers: Client Services, Creative, Motion & Media, Operations, People, Strategy, Technology, UX & Product Design
* Secondary navigation items under Ideas: Reports, Perspectives, Books, Videos.
* Secondary navigation items under Contact: Atlanta, Brooklyn, DC, London, Los Angeles, Oakland, Toronto.

```
$ npm i && npm start
```

Nice to haves (things that we look for):

* Adherence to accessibility standards
* Documentation

At a high level the navigation will have two main states:

* <768px: Mobile. Hamburger icon will display in the top-left of the page. Clicking the hamburger will cause a card to push in and move the main content to the right. The card will contain nav and sub-nav items like showed in design file.
* \>= 768px: Desktop. The nav will display as a horizontal nav. Top level nav items will display sub-nav items when clicked. No hamburger will be shown.

## Version
